# NeuroMemory is an open-source, modular memory engine designed to give AI agents the ability to remember, retrieve, and update long-term knowledge across sessions — a critical capability on the path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
# What It Does
NeuroMemory provides:
•	Long-term memory storage using vector embeddings and context indexing
•	Contextual retrieval of relevant past knowledge based on queries
•	Memory update logic to revise outdated or redundant information
•	FastAPI interface for easy integration with LLMs, chatbots, and autonomous agents
Think of it as an extendable "brain plugin" for your AI systems.
# Core Technologies
•	Python 3.10+
•	FastAPI – API server
•	ChromaDB or FAISS – for vector memory storage
•	LangChain – to assist with text embedding and processing
•	SentenceTransformers / OpenAI – for text embeddings
•	Summarizers / LLMs for compression and abstraction
# Use Cases
•	Persistent memory for LLM-based agents (e.g., AutoGPT, LangChain agents)
•	Knowledge graphs that grow over time
•	AI systems that "learn by doing"
•	Context-aware chatbots or digital assistants
