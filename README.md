# NeuroMemory

**NeuroMemory** is a modular, plug-and-play memory engine for AI agents and LLMs. It provides long-term, contextual, and updateable memory using vector embeddings and natural language summaries — a foundational step toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

---

## What It Does

NeuroMemory offers:

- **Long-term memory storage** using vector embeddings and context indexing
- **Contextual retrieval** of relevant past knowledge
- **Memory update logic** to revise and compress knowledge over time
- **FastAPI interface** for integration with AI agents and LLMs

> Think of it as a "brain plugin" that enables agents to remember, grow, and adapt.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **FastAPI** – API framework
- **ChromaDB** or **FAISS** – Vector storage for memory indexing
- **LangChain** – For embedding, parsing, and agent tools
- **SentenceTransformers / OpenAI Embeddings** – Semantic text representation
- **Uvicorn** – Server for local or cloud API deployment

---

## Use Cases

- Persistent memory for autonomous agents (AutoGPT, LangChain agents)
- Context-aware conversational AI systems
- Lifelong learning systems with retrievable history
- Knowledge accumulation in research bots or digital assistants
